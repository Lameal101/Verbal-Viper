(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, let me share a tale,
'Bout a woman, who's always on the trail,
She's the one who holds it down, day and night,
The mom, the rock, the one who's always right,

She's the glue that holds the family tight,
The one who keeps it real, no matter the fight,
She's the one who wipes away the tears,
And calms the fears, through all the years,

(Chorus)
Moms, moms, they're the best,
Always on the move, never at rest,
They're the ones who give and give,
And never ask for anything to live,

(Verse 2)
She's the one who teaches us to be strong,
To stand up tall, and never be wrong,
She's the one who shows us how to love,
And how to forgive, from above,

She's the one who's always there to guide,
Through the ups and downs, the highs and the slide,
She's the one who's always on our side,
And helps us find our way, with a gentle pride,

(Bridge)
So here's to the moms, who work so hard,
Who sacrifice, and never get scarred,
Who put their needs last, and our needs first,
And always put a smile, on our worst,

(Chorus)
Moms, moms, they're the best,
Always on the move, never at rest,
They're the ones who give and give,
And never ask for anything to live,

(Outro)
So let's give it up, for the moms in our lives,
Who show us love, and never say goodbye,
They're the ones who make us strong,
And help us grow, all day long.
